# Project 11 - What To Wear Today

This project focuses on our What to Wear Today application. We expanded on our knowledge of React Router and included new features to our application as well as created mock API interactions through a JSON server.

New features included in this application are a toggle switch for temperature units allowing the user to change the units from fahrenheit to celcius, we can now navigate to a separate profile page through the use of routes learned in this sprint, the ability to add and delete new or old clothing items through use of POST and DELETE requests and also to fetch and save data to our website from a local mock server though a GET request.

# Project 14 - Fullstack What To Wear Today

This project is the first full stack implementation of the What To Wear Today application. It is the first time that I am connecting my React project to my Express project to provide user registration, a log in function, authentication, profile management, clothing item interactions including "liking" and "unliking" clothing item cards and finally a log out function.

Tackling this project introduced new featues to my WTWR app. I implemented a user registration and login. In these modals I also included a function to switch between registration modals and login modals just in case users accidentally clicked register by accident but needed to login and vice versa. I also created authentication with use of tokens. Other features implemented in this project are the use of an edit profile function in case you wanted to edit your name as well as avatar. This project also included the like/dislike and add/delete functionality of clothing items but only accessible if a user is logged in. Finally I created a log out function for users.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
