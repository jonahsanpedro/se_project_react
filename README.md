Project 11 - What To Wear Today

This project focuses on our What to Wear Today application. We expanded on our knowledge of React Router and included new features to our application as well as created mock API interactions through a JSON server.

New features included in this application are a toggle switch for temperature units allowing the user to change the units from fahrenheit to celcius, we can now navaigate to a separate profile page through the use of routes learned in this sprint, the ability to add and delete new or old clothing items through use of POST and DELETE requests and also to fetch and save data to our website from a local mock server though a GET request.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
